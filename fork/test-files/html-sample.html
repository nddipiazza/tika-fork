<p>II. 10. <b>Meiotic behavior of a barley-rye hybrid</b>.
<p>George Fedak, Ottawa Research Station, Central Experimental Farm, Ottawa,
Ontario K1A 0C6, Canada. "R"
<p>Many attempts have been made to hybridize rye with barley in many laboratories
without much success. The failures are apparently due to incompatibility
systems which prevent the formation of hybrid embryos. The post-pollination
application of GA has apparently helped to overcome the incompatibility
systems so that hybrid embryos are recovered. Several hundred hybrid seedlings
have been produced in our laboratory to date but all have turned chlorotic
and died at either the early seedling stage or late after producing only
aborted spikes. In our most recent attempt 3363 florets of six different
2-rowed spring diploid cultivars were pollinated with Petkus rye.
<p>Fifty-five hybrid seedlings were obtained, two with a chromosome number
of 2<u>n</u> = 15 and the remainder with the expected numbers of 2<u>n</u>
= 14. In somatic cells of the hybrid, the chromosomes of both species could
be identified by differences in size with chromosomes of the rye genome
being significantly larger. The nucleolar organizers (N.O.) of barley chromosome
6 and 7 were clearly visible (Figure 1) but the rye N.O. appeared to be
suppressed. The same phenomenon was observed at diakinesis of meiotic cells
where virtually all cells contained only one nucleolus and in 78% of these
cells only two small chromosomes, presumably those of barley were associated
with it (Figure 2). In the remaining cells only one chromosome was associated
with the nucleolus. Since both parental species contain N.O. chromosomes,
evidently in the hybrid the expression of one species (rye) was being suppressed
by the other (barley).

<p>A study of the meiotic behavior of chromosomes in the hybrid revealed
a minimal amount of chromosome pairing. The majority of chromosomes in
meiotic cells remained unpaired as univalents and only an average of .18
bivalents and .02 trivalents per cell was found to give an average chiasma
frequency of .22. Heteromorphic bivalents would have revealed pairing between
barley and rye chromosomes but none were observed. The lack of pairing
between chromosomes of the two species indicates either a lack of homology
between them or the existence of meiotic pairing control genes. The study
of only one hybrid plant makes it difficult to choose between the two alternatives.
